title:  "The Land of Sacred Waters: Hydropolitics in the Indian Subcontinent"

Water is one of the most basic needs for survival, but it also fuels commerce, trade and economic advancements. Water insecurity continues to be an indicator of instability in many regions of the Indian subcontinent, leading to shortage of drinking water, agriculture and food causing forced displacement and destruction of livelihoods. Usually these water bodies help form natural boundaries, and in several cases their access is shared by adjacent entities. The problem between transboundary water bodies is that the upstream regions can at any moment reduce, stop or pollute the flow of water to the downstream regions. This transforms water reserves into a competitive resource giving way to what is known as “Water World wars''. The theme of our project is to understand this hydropolitics in the Indian subcontinent, looking at the different scales of inter- and intra- hydropolitics and their varied repercussions.
